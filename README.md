# My Personal Website - sadeq.github.io

## What is the project
The project is a personal portfolio representing my work in photography and soon in film. The website includes 30MFF film and, in brief, what each actor thought during production. The website aims to create a cinematic experience in a web-interactive form.

## Theme
The theme of my website is based on simplicity and ease in a user interface. This process will allow the user to understand the visual context from the 30MFF film better. The website is divided into two sections. The first section is the biography and the demonstration of personal work through films or photographs. I choose to embed photography at most for this exercise because of my passion for the art. The index and about pages portray a color pallet centered around black and white to highlight the photos and establish a more significant meaning from them, The second section, centered around the 30MFF film, portrays a different feel and expression. For innstance, the current project page reveals a grayish blue that contrasts' other pages but additionally, arises a new feeling from the user. I thought of blue to showcase and explain our 30MFF theme of water and its importance in our lives. 

## Experience 
I am trying to involve film, story, and visual arts into one platform; thus, leading to an abstract idea. However, my initial aim was to create a theatrical experience on the web to examine and understand the users' behavior toward's a new mean of media representation. 

## Process
The process started by considering my portfolio at first and trying to understand the use of a carousel. The main page is the most important for most web pages and is viewed as a hook to the audience. In my case, my photographs could be regarded as a hook that could attract art lovers. Although the descriptions are minimalist in the photos, I aim to create short stories on the main page that attracts the general audience from narrative and art reveal.

The about page is what came next. I always wanted to create a website, and I took some reasonable time to polish my bio's statement in film and photography. I thought of the 'about' page in response to the 'index' because it is the next step that establishes the relationship between the audience and an artist.

On the other hand, 30MFF's approach is different from my bio because I did not know how the theme of water and blues would correspond to the overall portrayal of the website. Hence, I relied on grayish influences and black to represent 30MFF and mimic the website's overall feel.

## Challenges
I encountered many challenges through web development, and one of the most significant was the positioning of images, divs, etc. Another challenge I examined through my development was forgetting syntax; hence, it complicated my website's approach as intended.

## Evaluation
This assignment was a great exercise and a solid introduction to Html, CSS, and javascript. Nevertheless, the recent project page seems empty, and I want to fill it out with content. Additionally, I expected to have an interactive background in the recent project merely to satisfy the open gap. Regardless, my trial failed and caused many issues with the code, which discouraged me from embedding animation or a cursor follower in the page's background. Lastly, I researched and wrote my code from scratch to remove the white margins, although nothing of such worked. For instance, the CSS reset, padding:0, margin:0, or border:0 did not work and caused issues when assigning div and paragraph assembly.
